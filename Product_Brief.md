# 1. Executive Summary

Unearth is a pattern-driven chaos companion that helps users track and predict where they frequently misplace everyday items.

It begins as a lightweight, installable PWA focused on behavioral pattern logging.

It evolves into a scalable behavioral intelligence product that reveals environmental trends and reduces everyday stress.

Unearth is positioned initially as a personal build-in-public project, transitioning into a brand-first micro-SaaS.

# 2. Problem Definition

Recurring lost-item behavior causes:

- Stress spikes
- Time waste
- Emotional frustration
- Self-blame
- Repeated chaos loops

Existing solutions:

There is no:
- Behavior-first pattern tracker
- Privacy-first lightweight tool
- Playful insight-driven companion
- Installable web app focused solely on misplacement patterns

They lose items in patterns.

Unearth surfaces those patterns.
