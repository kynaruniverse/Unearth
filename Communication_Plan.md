# 1. Platform Strategy

Focus on 1 platform deeply first (X recommended).

Why am I like this?"

# 3. Tone Strategy

Phase 1:
Founder voice.
Honest.
Curious.
Slight humour.

Phase 2:
Gradual shift to:
"Unearth users are discovering..."

Remove heavy personal framing after traction builds.

---

# 4. Community Launch Targets

Reddit:
- r/ADHD
- r/productivity
- r/SideProject
- r/webdev

Angle:
"I built something that tracks where I always lose my stuff. Would love feedback."

Never spam.
Always ask for feedback, not downloads.

---

# 5. Feedback Loop

Every post should:
Ask one small question.

Examples:
"Would you use this?"
"Is this dumb or useful?"
"How often do you lose your keys?"

Engagement > promotion.
